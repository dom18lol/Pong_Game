# Pong_Game

# Project Concept
Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. 
The main idea is to recreate a game similar to the original, allowing for 2 players to be able to move the 
paddles and compete seeing who can keep the ball within the borders and let it past the least amount of times. 
This will be completed in Python programming language, without the use of external libraries for game development 
which would make the process much easier.

# How to play?
For the game to be played properly, two players are needed, one on each side to control a paddle. 
The score increases when the ball goes past a paddle on either side and when 15 points are reached 
a message comes up pronouncing the winner
